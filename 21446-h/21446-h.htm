<p>In the extreme end of a village a Fox one day went to have a peep
at a hen-roost. He had the bad luck to fall into a well, where he
swam first to this side, and then to that side, but could not get
out with all his pains. At last, as chance would have it, a poor
Goat came to the same place to seek for some drink. "So ho!
friend Fox," said he, "you quaff it off there at a great rate: I
hope by this time you have quenched your thirst." "Thirst!" said
the sly rogue; "what I have found here to drink is so clear, and
so sweet, that I cannot take my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> fill of it; do, pray, come down,
my dear, and have a taste of it." With that, in plumped the Goat
as he bade him; but as soon as he was down, the Fox jumped on his
horns, and leaped out of the well in a trice; and as he went off,
"Good bye, my wise friend," said he; "if you had as much brains
as you have beard, I should have been in the well still, and you
might have stood on the brink of it to laugh at me, as I now do
at you."</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>A rogue will give up the best friend he has to get out of a
scrape; so that we ought to know what a man is, that we may judge
how far we may trust to what he says.</p>

<h3>THE FROG AND THE OX.</h3>


<p>An old Frog, being wonderfully struck with the size and majesty
of an Ox that was grazing in the marshes, was seized with the
desire to expand herself to the same portly magnitude. After
puffing and swelling for some time, "What think you," said she,
to her young ones, "will this do?" "Far from it," said they.
"Will this?" "By no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> means." "But this surely will?" "Nothing
like it," they replied. After many fruitless and ridiculous
efforts to the same purpose, the foolish Frog burst her skin, and
miserably expired upon the spot.</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>To attempt what is out of our power, and to rival those greater
than ourselves, is sure to expose us to contempt and ruin.</p>

<h3>THE MAN AND HIS GOOSE.</h3>

<p>A <span class="smcap">certain</span> Man had a Goose, which laid him a golden egg every day.
But, not contented with this, which rather increased than abated
his avarice, he was resolved to kill the Goose, and cut up her
belly, so that he might come to the inexhaustible treasure which
he fancied she had within her, without being obliged to wait for
the slow production of a single egg daily. He did so, and, to his
great sorrow and disappointment, found nothing within.</p>

brought on ruin.</p>

<h3>THE LION AND OTHER BEASTS.</h3>


<p>The Bull, and several other beasts, were ambitious of the honour
of hunting with the Lion. His savage Majesty graciously
condescended to their desire; and it was agreed that they should
have an equal share in whatever might be taken. They scour the
forest, are unanimous in the pursuit, and, after a long chase,
pull down a noble stag. It was divided with great dexterity by
the Bull into four equal parts; but just as he was going to
secure his share&mdash;"Hold!" says the Lion, "let no one presume to
help himself till he hath heard our just and reasonable claims. I
seize upon the first quarter by virtue of my prerogative; the
second I claim as due to my superior conduct and courage; I
cannot forego the third, on account of the necessities of my den;
and if anyone is inclined to dispute my right to the fourth, let
him speak." Awed by the majesty of his frown, and the terror of
his paws, they silently withdrew, resolving never to hunt again
but with their equals.</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>Be certain that those who have great power are honest before you
place yourselves in their hands, or you will be deprived of your
just rights.</p>

<h3>THE DOVE AND THE ANT.</h3>


<p>The Ant, compelled by thirst, went to drink in a clear, purling
rivulet; but the current, with its circling eddy, snatched her
away, and carried her down the stream. A Dove, pitying her
distressed condition, cropped a branch from a neighbouring tree
and let it fall into the water, by means of which the Ant saved
herself and got ashore. Not long after, a Fowler, having a design
against the Dove, planted his nets in due order, without the
bird's observing what he was about; which the Ant perceiving,
just as he was going to put his design into execution, she bit
his heel, and made him give so sudden a start, that the Dove took
the alarm, and flew away.</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>Kindness to others seldom fails of its reward; and none is so
weak that he may not be able in some fashion to repay it. Let us
show kindness without looking for a return, but a blessing will
surely follow.</p>

<h3>THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Fox</span> being caught in a steel trap by his tail, was glad to
compound for his escape with the loss of it; but on coming abroad
into the world, began to be so sensible of the disgrace such a
defect would bring upon him, that he almost wished he had died
rather than left it behind him. However, to make the best of a
bad matter, he formed a project in his head to call an assembly
of the rest of the Foxes, and propose it for their imitation as a
fashion which would be very agreeable and becoming. He did so,
and made a long harangue upon the unprofitableness of tails in
general, and endeavoured chiefly to show the awkwardness and
inconvenience of a Fox's tail in particular; adding that it would
be both more graceful and more expeditious to be altogether
without them, and that, for his part, what he had only imagined
and conjectured before, he now found by experience; for that he
never enjoyed himself so well, nor found himself so easy as he
had done since he cut off his tail. He said no more, but looked
about with a brisk air to see what proselytes he had gained; when
a sly old Fox in the company, who understood trap, answered
him, with a leer, "I believe you may have found a conveniency
in parting with your tail; and when we are in the same
circumstances, perhaps we may do so too."</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Wolf</span>, after too greedily devouring his prey, happened to have a
bone stick in his throat, which gave him so much pain that he
went howling up and down, and importuning every creature he met
to lend him a kind hand in order to his relief; nay, he even
promised a reward to anyone who should undertake the operation

reward, and having first made the Wolf confirm his promise with
an oath, undertook the business, and ventured his long neck into
the rapacious felon's throat.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Diamond</span>, of great beauty and lustre, observing, not only many

keep his distance, and pay a proper respect to his superiors.</p>

<p>"I find," said the Loadstone, "you judge by external appearances,
and condemn without due examination; but I will not act so
ungenerously by you. I am willing to allow you your due praise:
you are a pretty bauble; I am mightily delighted to see you
glitter and sparkle; I look upon you with pleasure and surprise;

<h3>THE FROGS DESIRING A KING.</h3>


<p>The Frogs, living an easy, free life everywhere among the lakes
and ponds, assembled together one day, in a very tumultuous
manner, and petitioned Jupiter to let them have a king, who might
inspect their morals, and make them live a little honester.
Jupiter, being at that time in pretty good humour, was pleased to
laugh heartily at their ridiculous request, and, throwing a
little log down into the pool, cried, "There is a king for you!"
The sudden splash which this made by its fall into the water, at
first terrified them so exceedingly that they were afraid to come
near it. But, in a little time, seeing it lie still without
moving, they ventured, by degrees, to approach it; and at last,
finding there was no danger, they leaped upon it, and, in short,
treated it as familiarly as they pleased. But, not contented with
so insipid a king as this was, they sent their deputies to
petition again for another sort of one; for this they neither did
nor could like. Upon that he sent them a Stork, who, without any
ceremony, fell devouring and eating them up, one after another,
as fast as he could. Then they applied themselves privately to
Mercury, and got him to speak to Jupiter in their behalf, that he
would be so good as to bless them again with another king,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> or
restore them to their former state. "No," says he; "since it was
their own choice, let the obstinate wretches suffer the
punishment due to their folly."</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>This fable teaches that it is better to be content with our
present condition, however bad we may think it, than, by
ambitious change, to risk making it worse.</p>

covert there; they shot their arrows at a venture, and killed the
Goat, who, before he expired, uttered his dying words to this
purpose: "Ah! I suffer justly for my ingratitude, who could not
forbear doing an injury to the vine that had so kindly afforded

Stork. He accordingly invited her to dinner in due form. But when
she came to the table, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> Stork found it consisted entirely of
different soups, served in broad, shallow dishes, so that she
could only dip the end of her bill in them, but could not
possibly satisfy her hunger. The Fox lapped them up very readily,
and every now and then addressing himself to his guest, desired
to know how she liked her entertainment, hoped that everything
was to her liking, and protested he was very sorry to see her eat
so sparingly.</p>

<p>The Stork, perceiving she was jested with, took no notice, but
pretended to like every dish extremely; and, at parting, pressed
the Fox so earnestly to return her visit that he could not, in
civility, refuse.</p>

<p>The day arrived, and he repaired to his appointment. But, to his
great dismay, he found the dinner was composed of minced meat,
served up in long, narrow-necked bottles; so that he was only
tantalized with the sight of what it was impossible for him to
taste. The Stork thrust in her long bill, and helped herself very
plentifully; then, turning to Reynard, who was eagerly licking
the outside of a jar where some sauce had been spilled, "I am
very glad," said she, smiling, "that you appear to have so good
an appetite. I hope you will make as hearty a dinner at my table
as I did the other day at yours." The Fox hung down his head, and
looked very much displeased. "Nay, nay!" said the Stork; "don't
pretend to be out of humour about the matter; they that cannot
take a jest should never make one."</p>

entirely defeated his enemy, but was mightily disappointed when,
upon returning thanks, and desiring to be dismissed, he received

<h3>THE VAIN JACKDAW.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">certain</span> Jackdaw was so proud and ambitious that, not contented
to live within his own sphere, he picked up the feathers which
fell from the Peacocks, stuck them among his own, and very
confidently introduced himself into an assembly of those
beautiful birds. They soon found him out, stripped him of his
borrowed plumes, and falling upon him with their sharp bills,
punished him as his presumption deserved.</p>

<p>Upon this, full of grief and affliction, he returned to his old
companions, and would have flocked with them again; but they,
knowing his late life and conversation, industriously avoided
him, and refused to admit him into their company; and one of
them, at the same time, gave him this serious reproof: "If,
friend, you could have been contented with your station, and had
not disdained the rank in which nature had placed you, you had
not been used so scurvily by those amongst whom you introduced
yourself, nor suffered the notorious slight which we now think
ourselves obliged to put upon you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

nothing but your trouble for your pains. Make a meal of me,

<h3>THE WOLF AND THE LAMB.</h3>


<p>One hot, sultry day, a Wolf and a Lamb happened to come just at
the same time to quench their thirst in the stream of a clear,
silver brook, that ran tumbling down the side of a rocky
mountain. The Wolf stood upon the higher ground, and the Lamb at
some distance from him down the current. However, the Wolf,
having a mind to pick a quarrel with him, asked him what he meant
by disturbing the water, and making it so muddy that he could not
drink, and at the same time demanded satisfaction. The Lamb,
frightened at this threatening charge, told him, in a tone as
mild as possible, that, with humble submission, he could not
conceive how that could be, since the water which he drank ran
down from the Wolf to him, and therefore it could not be
disturbed so far up the stream. "Be that as it will," replies the
Wolf, "you are a rascal; and I have been told that you treated me
with ill-language behind my back about half a year ago." "Upon my
word," says the Lamb, "the time you mention was before I was
born." The Wolf finding it to no purpose to argue any longer
against truth, fell into a great passion, snarling and foaming at
the mouth, as if he had been mad; and, drawing nearer to the
Lamb, "Sirrah," said he, "if it was not you, it was your father,
and that's all one." So he seized the poor innocent, helpless
thing, tore it to pieces, and made a meal of it.</p>

<p>Bad men, who wish to quarrel, will always find a pretence; if

<p>A <span class="smcap">little</span> starveling rogue of a Mouse had, with much pushing
application, made his way through a small hole in a corn-basket,
where he stuffed and crammed so plentifully, that, when he would
have retired the way he came, he found himself too plump, with
all his endeavours, to accomplish it. A Weasel, who stood at some
distance, and had been diverting himself with beholding the vain
efforts of the little fat thing, called to him, and said,
"Harkee, honest friend; if you have a mind to make your escape,

<h3>THE CHARGER AND THE ASS.</h3>


<p>The Horse, adorned with his great war-saddle, and champing his
foaming bridle, came thundering along the way, and made the
mountains echo with his loud, shrill neighing. He had not gone
far before he overtook an Ass, who was labouring under a heavy
burthen, and moving slowly on in the same track with himself.
Immediately he called out to him, in a haughty, imperious tone,
and threatened to trample him in the dirt, if he did not make way
for him. The poor, patient Ass, not daring to dispute the matter,
quietly got out of his way as fast as he could, and let him go
by. Not long after this, the same Horse, in an engagement with
the enemy, happened to be shot in the eye, which made him unfit
for show or any military business; so he was stript of his fine
ornaments, and sold to a carrier. The Ass, meeting him in this
forlorn condition, thought that now it was his time to speak; and
so, says he, "Heyday, friend, is it you? Well, I always believed
that pride of yours would one day have a fall."</p>

<h3>THE LARK AND HER YOUNG ONES.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Lark</span>, who had young ones in a field of corn almost ripe, was
under some fear lest the reapers should come to reap it before
her young brood was fledged and able to remove from that place.
She, therefore, upon flying abroad to look for food, left this
charge with them&mdash;to take notice what they heard talked of in her
absence, and tell her of it when she came back again.</p>

<p>When she was gone, they heard the owner of the corn call to his
son: "Well," says he, "I think this corn is ripe enough. I would
have you go early to-morrow, and desire our friends and
neighbours to come and help us to reap it." When the old Lark
came home, the young ones fell a quivering and chirping round
her, and told her what had happened, begging her to remove them
as fast as she could. The mother bid them be easy: "For," said
she, "if the owner depends on his friends and neighbours, I am
pretty sure the corn will not be reaped to-morrow."</p>

<p>Next day, she went out again, leaving the same orders as before.
The owner came, and staid, expecting his friends; but the sun
grew hot, and nothing was done, for not a soul came to help them.
Then says he to his son, "I perceive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> these friends of ours are
not to be depended upon; so you must go to your uncles and
cousins, and tell them I desire they would be here betimes
to-morrow morning, to help us to reap." Well, this the young
ones, in a great fright, reported also to their mother. "If that
be all," says she, "do not be frightened, dear children; for
kindred and relations are not so very forward to serve one
another; but take particular notice what you hear said next time,
and be sure you let me know it."</p>

<p>She went abroad next day, as usual; and the owner, finding his
relations as slack as the rest of his neighbours, said to his
son, "Harkee, George; get a couple of good sickles ready against
to-morrow morning, and we will even reap the corn ourselves."
When the young ones told their mother this, "Then," said she, "we
must be gone indeed; for, when a man undertakes to do his
business himself, it is not so likely he will be disappointed."
So she removed her young ones at once, and the corn was reaped
next day by the good man and his son.</p>

the Crow upon the subject of her beauty. "I protest," says he, "I
never observed it before, but your feathers are of a more
delicate white than any that ever I saw in my life! Ah! what a
fine shape and graceful turn of body is there! And I make no
question but you have a tolerable voice. If it is but as fine as
your complexion, I do not know a bird that can pretend to stand
in competition with you." The Crow foolishly believed all that
the Fox said was true; but, thinking the Fox a little dubious as
to her vocal powers, and having a mind to set him right in that
matter, opened her mouth, and, in the same instant, let the
cheese drop out of her mouth. This being what the Fox wanted, he

<h3>THE PEACOCK'S COMPLAINT.</h3>


<p>The Peacock presented a memorial to Juno, importing how hardly he
thought he was used, in not having so good a voice as the
Nightingale; how that bird was agreeable to every ear that heard
it, while he was laughed at for his ugly, screaming noise, if he
did but open his mouth.</p>

<p>The goddess, concerned at the uneasiness of her favourite bird,
answered him very kindly to this purpose:&mdash;"If the Nightingale is
blest with a fine voice, you have the advantage in point of
beauty and size." "Ah!" says he, "but what avails my silent,
unmeaning beauty, when I am so far excelled in voice?"</p>

<p>The goddess dismissed him, bidding him consider that the
properties of every creature were appointed by the decree of
Fate; to him beauty, to the Eagle strength, to the Nightingale a
voice of melody, to the Parrot the faculty of speech, and to the
Dove innocence; that each of these was contented with his own
peculiar quality; and, unless he wished to be miserable, he must
also learn to be equally satisfied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE STAG IN THE OX-STALL.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Stag</span>, roused from his thick covert in the midst of the forest,
and driven hard by the hounds, made towards a farm-house, and,
seeing the door of an ox-stall open, entered therein, and hid
himself under a heap of straw. One of the oxen, turning his head
about, asked him what he meant by venturing himself in such a
place, where he was sure to meet his doom. "Ah!" said the Stag,
"if you will but be so good as to favour me with your
concealment, I hope I shall do well enough; I intend to make off
again the first opportunity."</p>

<p>Well, he stayed there till towards night; in came the ox-man with
a bundle of fodder, and never saw him. In short, all the servants
of the farm came and went, and not one of them suspected anything
of the matter. Nay, the bailiff himself came, according to form,
and looked in, but walked away, no wiser than the rest. Upon this
the Stag,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> ready to jump out of his skin for joy, began to return
thanks to the good-natured Oxen, protesting that they were the
most obliging people he had ever met with in his life.</p>

<p>After he had done his compliments, one of them answered him,
gravely, "Indeed, we desire nothing more than to have it in our
power to contribute to your escape, but there is a certain person
you little think of who has a hundred eyes; if he should happen
to come, I would not give this straw for your life."</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, home comes the master himself from a
neighbour's, where he had been invited to dinner; and, because he
had observed the cattle not look well of late, he went up to the
rack, and asked why they did not give them more fodder; then,
casting his eyes downward, "Heydey!" says he, "why so sparing of
your litter? pray scatter a little more here. And these
cobwebs&mdash;But I have spoken so often that, unless I do it
myself&mdash;" Thus, as he went on, prying into everything, he chanced
to look where the Stag's horns lay sticking out of the straw;
upon which he raised a hue and cry, called his people about him,
killed the Stag, and made a prize of him.</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>For a work to be done thoroughly, it ought to be done by oneself;

<h3>THE WIND AND THE SUN.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">dispute</span> once arose betwixt the North Wind and the Sun about the
superiority of their power; and they agreed to try their strength
upon a traveller, which should be able to get off his cloak
first.</p>

<p>The North Wind began, and blew a very cold blast, accompanied
with a sharp, driving shower. But this, and whatever else he
could do, instead of making the man quit his cloak, obliged him
to gird it about his body as close as possible.</p>

<p>Next came the Sun, who, breaking out from the thick, watery
cloud, drove away the cold vapours from the sky, and darted his
warm, sultry beams upon the head of the poor weather-beaten
traveller. The man, growing faint with the heat, and unable to
endure it any longer, first throws off his heavy cloak, and then
flies for protection to the shade of a neighbouring grove.</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<h3>THE TRAVELLERS AND THE BEAR.</h3>


<p>Two men, being about to travel through a forest together,
mutually promised to stand by each other in any danger they
should meet on the way. They had not gone far when a Bear came
rushing towards them out of a thicket; upon which, one, being a
light, nimble fellow, got up into a tree. The other, falling flat
upon his face, and holding his breath, lay still, while the Bear
came up and smelled at him; but that creature, supposing him to
be a dead carcass, went back to the wood without doing him the
least harm. When all was over, the man who had climbed the tree
came down to his companion, and, with a pleasant smile, asked
what the Bear had said to him; "For," says he, "I took notice
that he clapped his mouth very close to your ear." "Why," replied
the other, "he charged me to take care, for the future, not to
put any confidence in such cowardly rascals as you are."</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>Nothing is more common than to hear people profess friendship
when there is no occasion for it; but he is a true friend who is
ready to assist us in the time of danger and difficulty. Choose,
therefore, friends whom you can depend on for such a time, and
greatly value them.</p>

<h3>THE DOG AND THE SHADOW.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">dog</span>, crossing a small rivulet, with a piece of flesh in his
mouth, which he had stolen from a butcher's shop, saw his own
shadow represented in the clear mirror of the limpid stream; and,
believing it to be another dog who was carrying another piece of
flesh, he could not forbear catching at it, but was so far from
getting anything by his greedy design, that he dropped the piece
he had in his mouth, which immediately sank to the bottom, and
was irrecoverably lost.</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>It is the just punishment of greediness to lose the substance by
grasping at the shadow; while the man who would take what does
not belong to him deserves to lose what he has.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">hare</span> twitted a Tortoise on account of his slowness, and vainly
boasted of her own great speed in running. "Let us make a match,"
replied the Tortoise: "I'll run with you five miles for five
pounds, and the Fox yonder shall be the umpire of the race." The
Hare agreed, and away they both started together. But the Hare,
by reason of her exceeding swiftness, outran the Tortoise to such
a degree that she made a jest of the matter, and, finding herself
a little tired, squatted in a tuft of fern that grew by the way,
and took a nap, thinking that, if the Tortoise went by, she could
at any time catch him up with all the ease imaginable. In the
meanwhile the Tortoise came jogging on, with a slow but continued
motion; and the Hare, out of a too great security and confidence
of victory, oversleeping herself, the Tortoise arrived at the end
of the race first.</p>

<h3>THE COUNTRY MOUSE AND THE CITY MOUSE.</h3>


<p>An honest, plain, sensible country Mouse is said to have
entertained at his hole one day a fine Mouse of the town. Having
formerly been playfellows together, they were old acquaintances,
which served as an apology for the visit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> However, as master of
the house, he thought himself obliged to do the honours of it, in
all respects, and to make as great a stranger of his guest as he
possibly could. In order to this, he set before him a reserve of
delicate grey pease and bacon, a dish of fine oatmeal, some
parings of new cheese, and, to crown all with a dessert, a
remnant of a charming mellow apple.</p>

<p>In good manners, he forebore to eat any of it himself, lest the
stranger should not have enough; but, that he might seem to bear
the other company, sat and nibbled a piece of wheaten straw very
busily. At last, says the spark of the town, "Old croney, give me
leave to be a little free with you. How can you bear to live in
this nasty, dirty, melancholy hole here, with nothing but woods
and meadows, mountains and rivulets about you? Do you not prefer
the busy world to the chirping of birds, and the splendour of a
court to the rude aspect of an uncultivated desert? Come, take my
word for it, you will find it a change for the better. Stand not
considering, but away this moment. Remember, we are not immortal,
and therefore have no time to lose. Make sure of to-day, and
spend it as agreeably as you can; you know not what may happen
to-morrow."</p>

<p>In short, these and such like arguments prevailed, and his
country friend was resolved to go to town that night. So they
both set out upon their journey, proposing to sneak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> in after the
close of the evening. They did so, and about midnight made their
entry into a certain great house, where there had been an
extraordinary entertainment the day before, and several tit-bits,
which some of the servants had purloined, were hid under a seat
of a window. The country guest was immediately placed in the
midst of a rich Persian carpet; and now it was the courtier's
turn to entertain, who, indeed, acquitted himself in that
capacity with the utmost readiness and address, changing the
courses as elegantly, and tasting everything first as
judiciously, as any clerk of the kitchen. The other sat and
enjoyed himself like a delighted epicure, tickled to the last
degree with this new turn of his affairs; when, on a sudden, a
noise of somebody opening the door made them start from their
seats and scuttle in confusion about the dining-room. Our country
friend, in particular, was ready to die with fear at the barking
of a huge Mastiff or two, which opened their throats just about
the same time, and made the whole house echo.</p>

<p>At last, recovering himself, "Well," says he, "if this be your
town life, much good may you do with it; give me my poor, quiet
hole again, with my homely but comfortable grey pease."</p>

<h3>THE CAT AND THE MICE.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">certain</span> house was much infested with Mice; but at last they got
a Cat, who caught and ate every day some of them. The Mice,
finding their numbers grow thin, consulted what was best to be
done for the preservation of the public from the jaws of the
devouring Cat. They debated and came to this resolution, that no
one should go down below the upper shelf.</p>

<p>The Cat, observing the Mice no longer came down as usual, hungry
and disappointed of her prey, had recourse to this
stratagem:&mdash;She hung by her hind legs on a peg which stuck in the
wall, and made as if she had been dead, hoping by this lure to
entice the Mice to come down. She had not been in this posture
long before a cunning old Mouse peeped over the edge of the
shelf, and spoke thus:&mdash;"Ha! ha! my good friend, are you there?
There you may be! I would not trust myself with you, though your
skin were stuffed with straw."</p>

<h3>THE KID AND THE WOLF.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Kid</span>, being mounted upon the roof of a lofty shed, and seeing a
Wolf below, loaded him with all manner of reproaches. Upon which,
the Wolf, looking up, replied, "Do not vaunt yourself, vain
creature, and think you mortify me; for I look upon this ill
language as not coming from you, but from the place that protects
you."</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>To rail or give bad language is wrong at all times; but when a

<h3>THE ASS AND THE LITTLE DOG.</h3>


<p>The Ass, observing how great a favourite a little Dog was with
his master, how much caressed, and fondled, and fed with good
bits at every meal, and for no other reason, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> he could
perceive, but skipping and frisking about, wagging his tail, and
leaping up in his master's lap, was resolved to imitate the same,
and see whether such behaviour would not procure him the same
favours. Accordingly, the master was no sooner come home from
walking about his fields and gardens, and was seated in his easy
chair, than the Ass, who observed him, came gamboling and braying
towards him, in a very awkward manner. The master could not help
laughing aloud at the odd sight. But the jest soon became
earnest, when he felt the rough salute of the fore-feet, as the
Ass, raising himself upon his hinder legs, pawed against his
breast with a most loving air, and would fain have jumped into
his lap. The good man, terrified at this outrageous conduct, and
unable to endure the weight of so heavy a beast, cried out; upon
which one of his servants, running in with a good stick, and
laying heartily upon the bones of the poor Ass, soon convinced
him that everyone who desires it is not qualified to be a
favourite.</p>

satisfaction.</p>

<h3>THE LION AND THE FOUR BULLS.</h3>


<p>Four Bulls, which had entered into a very strict friendship, kept
always near one another, and fed together. The Lion often saw
them, and as often wished to make one of them his prey; but
though he could easily have subdued any of them singly, yet he
was afraid to attack the whole when together, knowing they would
have been too hard for him; and, therefore, contented himself for
the present with keeping at a distance. At last, perceiving no
attempt was to be made upon them as long as their combination
lasted, he took occasion, by whispers and hints, to foment
jealousies and raise divisions among them.</p>

<p>This stratagem succeeded so well, that the Bulls grew cold and
reserved towards one another, which soon after ripened into a
downright hatred and aversion, and, at last, ended in a total
separation. The Lion had now obtained his ends; and, as
impossible as it was for him to hurt them while they were united,
he found no difficulty, now they were parted, to seize and devour
every Bull of them, one after another.</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>Union is strength. Jealousy and envy, especially when fomented by

<p>The Leopard one day took it into his head to value himself upon
the great variety and beauty of his spots; and, truly, he saw no
reason why even the lion should take place of him, since he could
not show so beautiful a skin. As for the rest of the wild beasts
of the forests, he treated them all, without distinction, in the
most haughty and disdainful manner. But the Fox, being among
them, went up to him with a great deal of spirit and resolution,
and told him that he was mistaken in the value he was pleased to
set upon himself, since people of judgment were not used to form
their opinion of merit from an outside appearance, but by
considering the good qualities and endowments with which the mind
was stored within.</p>

<h3>THE BELLY AND THE MEMBERS.</h3>


<p>In former days, when the Belly and the other parts of the body
enjoyed the faculty of speech, and had separate views and designs
of their own; each part, it seems, in particular, for himself,
and in the name of the whole, took exception at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> the conduct of
the Belly, and were resolved to grant him supplies no longer.</p>

<p>They said they thought it very hard that he should lead an idle,
good-for-nothing life, spending and squandering away upon his own
vile appetites all the fruits of their labour; and that, in
short, they were resolved for the future to strike off his
allowance, and let him shift for himself as well as he could.</p>

<p>The hands protested they would not lift a finger to keep him from
starving; and the mouth wished he might never speak again if he
took in the least bit of nourishment for him as long as he lived;
and the teeth said, "May we be rotten if ever we chew a morsel
for him for the future!" This solemn league and covenant was kept
so long, until each of the rebel members pined away to the skin
and bone, and could hold out no longer. Then they found there was
no doing without the Belly, and that, as idle and insignificant

<h3>THE JACKDAW AND THE EAGLE.</h3>


<p>An Eagle flew down from the top of a high rock, and settled upon
the back of a lamb, and then, instantly flying up into the air
again, bore his bleating prize aloft in his talons. A Jackdaw,
who sat upon an elm, and beheld his exploit, resolved to imitate
it. So, flying upon the back of a ram, and entangling his claws
in the wool, he fell a-chattering and attempting to fly; by which
means he drew the observation of the shepherd upon him, who,
finding his feet hampered in the fleece of the ram, easily took
him, and gave him to his boys for their sport and diversion,
saying, "The silly bird thought he was an Eagle; but, no doubt,
by this time he has found out he is but a Jackdaw."</p>

<h3>THE ASS AND THE LION HUNTING.</h3>


<p>The Lion took a fancy to hunt in company with the Ass; and, to
make him the more useful, gave him instructions to hide himself
in a thicket, and then to bray in the most frightful manner that
he could possibly contrive. "By this means," says he, "you will
rouse all the beasts within hearing of you, while I stand at the
outlets and take them as they are making off." This was done; and
the stratagem took effect accordingly. The Ass brayed most
hideously, and the timorous beasts, not knowing what to make of
it, began to scour off as fast as they could; when the Lion, who
was posted at a convenient place, seized and devoured them as he
pleased.</p>

<p>Having got his belly full, he called out to the Ass, and bid him
leave off braying, as he had had enough. Upon this the lop-eared
brute came out of his ambush, and, approaching the Lion, asked
him, with an air of conceit, "how he liked his performance."
"Prodigiously," says he; "you did it so well, that I protest, had
I not known your nature and temper, I might have been frightened
myself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

fastened a rope about his neck, tying him up to a tree which
stood hard by.</p>

<p>Some other Shepherds happening to pass that way, and observing
what he was about, drew near, and expressed their wonder at it.
"What," says one of them, "Brother, do you hang Sheep?" "No,"

<h3>THE TWO BEES.</h3>


<p>On a fine morning in May, two Bees set forward in quest of honey;
the one, wise and temperate; the other, careless and extravagant.
They soon arrived at a garden enriched with aromatic herbs, the
most fragrant flowers, and the most delicious fruits. They
regaled themselves for a time on the various dainties that were
set before them: the one loading his thigh at intervals with
provisions for the hive against the distant winter, the other
revelling in sweets, without regard to anything but his present
gratification.</p>

<p>At length, they found a wide-mouthed vial, that hung beneath the
bough of a peach-tree, filled with honey ready tempered, and
exposed to their taste in the most alluring manner. The
thoughtless Epicure, spite of all his friend's remonstrances,
plunged headlong into the vessel, resolving to indulge himself in
all the pleasures of sensuality. The Philosopher, on the other
hand, sipped a little with caution, but, being suspicious of
danger, flew off to fruits and flowers; where, by the moderation
of his meals, he improved his relish for the true enjoyment of
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening, however, he called upon his friend, to inquire
whether he would return to the hive, but found him surfeited in
sweets, which he was as unable to leave as to enjoy. Clogged in
his wings, enfeebled in his feet, and his whole frame totally
enervated, he was but just able to bid his friend adieu, and to
lament, with his latest breath, that though a taste of pleasure
may quicken the relish of life, an unrestrained indulgence is
inevitable destruction.</p>

<h3>THE DOG AND THE WOLF.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">lean</span>, hungry, half-starved Wolf happened, one moonshiny night,
to meet a jolly, plump, well-fed Mastiff; and after the first
compliments were passed, says the Wolf, "You look extremely well;
I protest, I think I never saw a more graceful, comely person;
but how comes it about, I beseech you, that you should live so
much better than I? I may say, without vanity, that I venture
fifty times more than you do, and yet I am almost ready to perish
with hunger." The Dog answered very bluntly, "Why, you may live
as well, if you do the same for it as I do." "Indeed! what is
that?" says he. "Why," says the Dog, "only to guard the house at
night, and keep it from thieves." "With all my heart," replies
the Wolf, "for at present I have but a sorry time of it; and I
think to change my hard lodging in the woods, where I endure
rain, frost, and snow, for a warm roof over my head and enough of
good victuals, will be no bad bargain." "True," says the Dog;
"therefore you have nothing to do but to follow me."</p>

<p>Now, as they were jogging on together, the Wolf spied a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>crease
in the Dog's neck, and having a strange curiosity, could not
forbear asking him what it meant! "Pugh! nothing," says the Dog.
"Nay, but pray," says the Wolf. "Why," says the Dog, "if you must
know, I am tied up in the day-time, because I am a little fierce,
for fear I should bite people, and am only let loose at nights.
But this is done with a design to make me sleep by day, more than
anything else, and that I may watch the better in the night time;
for, as soon as ever the twilight appears, out I am turned, and
may go where I please. Then my master brings me plates of bones
from the table with his own hands; and whatever scraps are left
by any of the family, all fall to my share; for, you must know, I
am a favourite with everybody. So you see how you are to
live.&mdash;Come, come along; what is the matter with you?" "No,"
replied the Wolf, "I beg your pardon; keep your happiness all to
yourself. Liberty is the word with me; and I would not be a king
upon the terms you mention."</p>

<h3>THE SATYR AND THE TRAVELLER.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Satyr</span>, as he was ranging the forest in an exceedingly cold,
snowy season, met with a Traveller half starved with the
extremity of the weather. He took compassion on him, and kindly
invited him home to a warm, comfortable cave he had in a hollow
of a rock. As soon as they had entered and sat down,
notwithstanding there was a good fire in the place, the chilled
Traveller could not forbear blowing his finger-ends.</p>

<p>Upon the Satyr asking him why he did so, he answered that he did
it to warm his hands. The honest Sylvan having seen little of the
world, admired a man who was master of so valuable a quality as
that of blowing heat; and, therefore, was resolved to entertain
him in the best manner he could. He spread the table before him
with dried fruits of several sorts, and produced a remnant of
cold cordial wine, which, as the rigour of the season made very
proper, he mulled with some warm spices, over the fire, and
presented to his shivering guest. But this the Traveller thought
fit to blow likewise; and upon the Satyr's demanding the reason
why he blowed again, he replied, to cool the dish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>This second answer provoked the Satyr's indignation, as much as
the first had kindled his surprise; so, taking the man by the
shoulder, he thrust him out, saying he would have nothing to do
with a wretch who had so vile a quality as to blow hot and cold
with the same mouth.</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>Double dealing is always detestable. The man that blows hot and

committed the care and tuition of the flock to the charge of his

constantly with sweet curds and whey, and sometimes threw him a
crust or two. Yet, notwithstanding this, no sooner was his back
turned, but the treacherous cur fell foul of the flock, and
devoured the sheep, instead of guarding and defending them. The
Shepherd being informed of this, was resolved to hang him; and
the Dog, when the rope was about his neck, and he was just going
to be hung, began to expostulate with his master, asking him, why
he was so unmercifully bent against him, who was his own servant
and creature, and had only committed two or three crimes, and why
he did not rather execute vengeance upon the Wolf, who was a
constant and declared enemy? "Nay," replies the Shepherd, "it is
for that very reason that I think you ten times more deserving of
death than he. From him I expected nothing but hostilities; and
therefore could guard against him. You I depended upon as a just
and faithful servant, and fed and encouraged you accordingly; and
therefore your treachery is the more notorious, and your
ingratitude the more unpardonable."</p>

agreeable turn to my whole face! If some other parts of my body
were but in proportion to them, I would turn my back to nobody;

<h3>THE LION, THE BEAR, AND THE FOX.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Lion</span> and a Bear quarrelling over the carcase of a Fawn, which
they found in the forest, their title to him had to be decided by
force of arms. The battle was severe and tough on both sides, and
they fought it out, tearing and worrying one another so long,
that, what with wounds and fatigue, they were so faint and weary,
that they were not able to strike another stroke. Thus, while
they lay upon the ground, panting and lolling out their tongues,
a Fox chanced to pass by that way, who, perceiving how the case
stood, very impudently stepped in between them, seized the booty
which they had all this while been contending for, and carried it
off. The two combatants, who lay and beheld all this, without
having strength to stir and prevent it, were only wise enough to
make this reflection:&mdash;"Behold the fruits of our strife and
contention! That villain, the Fox, bears away the prize, and we
ourselves have deprived each other of the power to recover it
from him."</p>

<h3>THE FOX AND THE GRAPES.</h3>


<p>In days of yore, when a young Fox would take more pains to get a
bunch of grapes than a plump, fat goose, an arch young thief cast
his eyes on a fine bunch which hung on the top of a poor man's
vine, and made him lick his lips like a hound at the sight of a
joint of meat. "Oh," said he, "how nice they look! I must have a
taste of them, if I die for it;" and with that, up he jumped with
all his might, but had the ill-luck not to reach the grapes; yet,
as he could not find in his heart to leave them, he tried for
them as long as he was able; so he leaped and jumped, and jumped
and leaped, till at last he was glad to rest. But when he found
all his pains were in vain, "Hang them!" said he, "I am sure they
are not fit to eat, for they are as sour as crabs, and would set
my teeth on edge for a whole week; and so I shall leave them for
the next fool who may chance to come this way."</p>

<h3>THE COCK AND THE FOX.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Cock</span>, being perched among the branches of a lofty tree, crowed
aloud, so that the shrillness of his voice echoed through the
wood and invited a Fox to the place, who was prowling in that
neighbourhood in quest of his prey. But Reynard, finding the Cock
was inaccessible by reason of the height of his situation, had
recourse to stratagem in order to decoy him down. So, approaching
the tree, "Cousin," says he, "I am heartily glad to see you; but
at the same time I cannot forbear expressing my uneasiness at the
inconvenience of the place, which will not let me pay my respects
to you in a handsomer manner; though I suppose you will come down
presently, and thus the difficulty will be easily removed."</p>

<p>"Indeed, cousin," says the Cock, "to tell you the truth, I do not
think it safe to venture upon the ground; for though I am
convinced how much you are my friend, yet I may have the
misfortune to fall into the clutches of some other beasts, and
what will become of me then?" "Oh, dear!" says Reynard, "is it
possible that you can be so ignorant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> as not to know of the
peace which has been lately proclaimed between all kinds of birds
and beasts; and that we are for the future to forbear hostilities
on all sides, and to live in the utmost love and harmony, and
this, under the penalty of suffering the severest punishment that
can be inflicted?" All this while the Cock seemed to give little
attention to what was said, but stretched out his neck, as if he
saw something at a distance.</p>

<p>"Cousin," says the Fox, "what is it that you look at so
earnestly?" "Why," says the Cock, "I think I see a pack of hounds
yonder, a little way off." "Oh, then," says the Fox, "your humble
servant, I must begone." "Nay, pray cousin, do not go," says the
Cock, "I am just coming down; surely you are not afraid of Dogs
in these peaceable times?" "No, no," says he, "but ten to one
whether they have heard of the proclamation yet."</p>

<h3>THE LION AND THE MOUSE.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Lion</span>, faint with heat and weary with hunting, was lying down to
take his repose under the spreading boughs of a thick shady oak.
It happened that while he slept, a company of scrambling mice ran
over his back, and waked him; upon which, starting up, he clapped
his paw upon one of them, and was just going to put it to death,
when the little supplicant implored his mercy in a very moving
manner, begging him not to stain his noble character with the
blood of so despicable and small a beast.</p>

<p>The Lion, considering the matter, thought proper to do as he was
desired, and immediately released his little trembling prisoner.</p>

<p>Not long after, while traversing the forest in pursuit of his
prey, he chanced to run into the toils of the hunters, from
whence, not being able to disengage himself, he set up a most
hideous and loud roar.</p>

<p>The Mouse, hearing a voice, and knowing it to be the Lion's,
immediately repaired to the place, and bid him fear nothing, for
that he was his friend. Then straight he fell to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>work, and
with his sharp little teeth gnawing asunder the knots and
fastenings of the toils, set the royal brute at liberty.</p>

<h3>THE HUSBANDMAN AND HIS SONS.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">certain</span> Husbandman, lying at the point of death, and being
desirous his sons should pursue that innocent, entertaining
course of agriculture in which he himself had been engaged all
his life, made use of this expedient to induce them to it. He
called them to his bed-side and spoke to this effect: "All the
patrimony I have to bequeath you, Sons, is my farm and my
vineyard, of which I make you joint heirs. But I charge you not
to let it go out of your own occupation; for if I have any
treasure besides, it lies buried somewhere in the ground, within
a foot of the surface."</p>

<p>This made the Sons conclude that he talked of money which he had
hid there; so, after their father's death, with unwearied
diligence and application, they carefully dug up every inch, both
of the farm and vineyard; from which it came to pass that, though
they missed the treasure which they expected, the ground, by
being so well stirred and loosened, produced so plentiful a crop
of all that was sowed in it as proved a real, and no

Death had been so near, and frightened almost out of his senses
with his terrible aspect, answered him, trembling, That, having
by chance let his bundle of sticks fall, and being too infirm to
get it up himself, he had made bold to call upon him to help him;

<h3>MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Man</span> was felling a tree on the bank of a river, and by chance
let his hatchet slip out of his hand, which dropped into the
water, and immediately sunk to the bottom. Being, therefore, in
great distress from the loss of his tool, he sat down and
bemoaned himself most lamentably.</p>

<p>Upon this, Mercury appeared to him, and being informed of the
cause of his complaint, dived to the bottom of the river, and,
coming up again, showed the man a golden hatchet, demanding if
that were his. He denied that it was;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> upon which Mercury dived a
second time, and brought up a silver one. The Man refused it,
alleging likewise that this was not his. He dived a third time,
and fetched up the individual hatchet the man had lost; upon
sight of which the poor fellow was overjoyed, and took it with
all humility and thankfulness. Mercury was so pleased with the
fellow's honesty, that he gave him the other two into the
bargain, as a reward for his just dealing.</p>

<p>The man then went to his companions, and, giving them an account
of what had happened, one of them went presently to the river
side, and let his hatchet fall designedly into the stream. Then,
sitting down upon the bank, he fell a-weeping and lamenting, as
if he had been really and sorely afflicted. Mercury appeared as
before, and, diving, brought him up a golden hatchet, asking if
that was the one he had lost. Transported at the precious metal,
he answered "Yes," and went to snatch it greedily. But the god,
detesting his abominable impudence, not only refused to give him
that, but would not so much as let him have his own hatchet
again.</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Goat</span>, going abroad to feed, shut up her young kid at home,
charging him to bolt the door fast, and open it to nobody, till
she herself should return. The Wolf, who lay lurking just by,
heard this charge given, and soon after came and knocked at the
door, counterfeiting the voice of the Goat, and desiring to be
admitted. The Kid, looking out of the window and discovering the
cheat, bid him go about his business; for however he might
imitate a Goat's voice, yet he appeared too much like a Wolf to
be trusted.</p>

<h3>THE OLD MAN AND HIS SONS.</h3>




<p>An Old Man had many Sons, who were often falling out with one
another. When the father had exerted his authority, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>and used
other means in order to reconcile them, and all to no purpose, he
at last had recourse to this expedient: he ordered his Sons to be
called before him, and a short bundle of sticks to be brought;
and then commanded them, one by one, to try if, with all their
might and strength, they could any of them break it. They all
tried, but to no purpose; for the sticks being closely and
compactly bound up together, it was impossible for the force of
man to do it.</p>

<p>After this the father ordered the bundle to be untied, and gave a
single stick to each of his Sons, at the same time bidding him
try to break it, which, when each did, with all imaginable ease,
the father addressed himself to them to this effect: "O, my sons,
behold the power of unity! for if you, in like manner, would but
keep yourselves strictly joined in the bonds of friendship, it
would not be in the power of any mortal to hurt you; but when
once the ties of brotherly affection are dissolved, how soon do
you fall to pieces, and become liable to be violated by every
injurious hand that assaults you."</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>Union is strength. Love is a powerful bond, which, when
cherished, will make those who are bound together by it
irresistible.</p>

<h3>THE MICE IN COUNCIL.</h3>


<p>The Mice called a general council, and, having met, after the
doors were locked, entered into a free consultation about ways
and means how to render their fortunes and estates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> more secure
from the danger of the Cat. Many things were offered, and much
was debated, "pro and con," upon the matter. At last, a young
Mouse, in a fine, florid speech, concluded with an expedient, and
that the only one, which was to put them for the future entirely
out of the power of the enemy; and this was that the Cat should
wear a bell about her neck, which, upon the least motion, would
give the alarm, and be a signal for them to retire into their
holes. This speech was received with great applause, and it was
even proposed by some that the Mouse who made it should have the
thanks of the assembly; upon which an old, grave Mouse, who had
sat silent all the while, stood up, and, in another speech, owned
that the contrivance was admirable, and the author of it, without
doubt, an ingenious Mouse, but, he said, he thought it would not
be so proper to vote him thanks till he should farther inform
them how this bell was to be fastened about the Cat's neck, and
what Mouse would undertake to do it.</p>

<h3>THE FOX IN THE WELL.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Fox</span>, having fallen into a well, made a shift by sticking his
claws into the sides to keep his head above water. Soon after a
Wolf came and peeped over the brink, to whom the Fox applied very
earnestly for assistance; entreating that he would help him to a
rope, or something of the kind, which might favour his escape.
The Wolf moved with compassion at his misfortune, could not
forbear expressing his concern. "Ah, poor Reynard," says he, "I
am sorry for you with all my heart; how could you possibly come
into this melancholy condition?"</p>

<p>"Nay, pr'ythee, friend," replied the Fox, "if you wish me well,
do not stand pitying me, but lend me some succour as fast as you
can; for pity is but cold comfort when one is up to the chin in
water, and within a hair's breadth of starving or drowning."</p>

<p>Mere expressions of pity, without a desire or attempt to

<p>Presently, meeting with a Horse, he bade him come with him into
the field, "For," says he, "I have found some capital oats; and I
have not tasted one, but have kept them all for you, for the very
sound of your teeth is music to my ear." But the Horse replied,
"A pretty fellow! if Wolves were able to eat oats, I suspect you

gentle stream, while the other rushed along with a sounding and
rapid current. "Sister," said the latter, "at the rate you move,
you will probably be dried up, before you advance much farther;
whereas, for myself, I will venture a wager, that, within two or
three hundred furlongs, I shall become navigable; and, after
distributing commerce and wealth wherever I flow, I shall
majestically proceed to pay my tribute to the ocean. So,
farewell, dear sister! and patiently submit to your fate."</p>

<p>Her sister made no reply; but, calmly descending to the meadows
below, increased her stream by numberless little rills which she
collected in her progress, till, at length, she was enabled to
rise into a considerable river; whilst the proud stream, who had
the vanity to depend solely upon her own sufficiency, continued a
shallow brook; and was glad, at last, to be helped forward, by
throwing herself into the arms of her despised sister.</p>

<h3>THE FOX AND THE SICK LION.</h3>


<p>It was reported that the Lion was sick, and the beasts were made
to believe that they could not make their court<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> better than by
going to visit him. Upon this, they generally went, but it was
particularly remarked that the Fox was not one of the number. The
Lion, therefore, dispatched one of his Jackals to sound him about
it, and to ask him why he had so little charity and respect as
never to come near him at a time when he lay so dangerously ill,
and everybody else had been to see him. "Why," replied the Fox,
"pray present my duty to his majesty, and tell him that I have
the same respect for him as ever, and have been coming several
times to kiss his royal paw, but I am so terribly frightened at
the mouth of his cave, to see the print of my fellow-subjects'
feet all pointing forwards, and none backwards, that I had not
resolution enough to venture in."</p>

<h3>THE ONE-EYED DOE.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Doe</span>, that had but one eye, used to graze near the sea, and that
she might be the more secure from harm, she kept her blind side
toward the water, from whence she had no apprehension of danger,
and with the other surveyed the country as she fed.</p>

<p>By this vigilance and precaution she thought herself in the
utmost security; when a sly fellow, with two or three of his
companions, who had been poaching after her several days to no
purpose, at last took a boat, and, fetching a compass upon the
sea, came gently down upon her, and shot her. The Doe, in the
agonies of death, breathed out this doleful complaint:&mdash;"Oh, hard
fate! that I should receive my death wound from that side whence
I expected no ill; and be safe in that part where I looked for
the most danger."</p>

<h3>THE FOX, THE RAVEN, AND THE DOVE.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Fox</span>, who was half-starved with hunger, stretched himself all
along upon the ground, and lay as if he were dead, that he might
entice the harmless birds to come within his reach, and then leap
of a sudden upon them, and make them his prey; but it happened
that a Raven, who was hovering near him, observed that he fetched
his breath; and, by consequence, found it to be only a trick in
him to catch the birds. She, therefore, instantly gave them
notice of it; and forewarned them, as they valued their own
lives, not to come within reach of the Fox, who only feigned
himself to be dead.</p>

<p>The Fox, finding his plot to be discovered, was obliged to go
away hungry; but soon bethought himself of another invention:
which was, to go and kennel himself in a hollow tree, upon which
a Dove had her nest, and was breeding up her young ones. Having
done this, he called to her, that, unless she would throw down to
him sometimes one of her eggs, and sometimes one of her young
ones, he would climb up the tree, take away all her eggs, kill
both her and her young, and break her nest to pieces.</p>

<p>The harmless Dove, thinking of two ills to choose the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> least, did
as the Fox required her; and threw him down now one of her eggs,
and then one of her young ones. Having done so, for some time,
with a great deal of grief and sorrow, and the Fox continuing
still to demand it of her, she, at last, made her complaint to
the Raven, who chanced to come and perch herself on the same
tree; grievously bemoaning her fate, that she, like a good
mother, to provide for her children, was at last obliged to make
them a sacrifice to such a villain. But the Raven, who was not so
timorous as she, advised her, whenever the Fox threatened her
again, that he would kill both her and her young, if she would
not throw one of them down to him, to answer him roundly,&mdash;"If
you could have flown or climbed up the tree, you would not have
been so often contented with one of my eggs, or of my young; but
would, long since, according to your ravenous and blood-thirsty
nature, have devoured both me and them." In short, the next time
the Fox came, and threatened her as before, she replied as the
Raven had instructed her.</p>

<p>The Fox, hearing her answer, and knowing very well that she was
not so wise and cunning of herself, resolved to find out the
truth of the matter; and, at length, came to understand that it
was the Raven who had been her counsellor. He, therefore, vowed
to be revenged on her, who had now, the second time, hindered him
from getting his prey. Not long after, he espied her sitting on a
high thorn-tree; and, going to her, began to praise her at a
mighty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> rate,&mdash;magnifying her good fortune above that of all
beasts, who could neither fly like her, nor tread the ground with
so majestical a gait: adding, withal, that it would be a great
pleasure to him to see her lordly walk; that he might from
thence, be certain whether she were indeed so divine and
prophetic a bird as men had always held her to be.</p>

<p>The Raven, transported to hear herself thus praised to the skies,
flew down; and, pitching upon the ground, walked to and fro, in
mighty pomp and state. The Fox seemed highly delighted; and said,
that he extremely wondered how the Raven could keep upon the
ground, when the wind blew her feathers over her eyes, and
hindered her sight; but chiefly when it blew before, behind, and
on all sides of her. "I can very well provide against that," said
the Raven; "for then I hide my head under my left wing." "How!"
cried the Fox; "hide your head under your left wing! So wonderful
a thing I can never believe, till I see it." Immediately the
Raven put her head under her left wing, and held it there so long
that the Fox caught hold of her and killed her for his prey.</p>

<h3>THE TWO FROGS.</h3>


<p>One hot, sultry summer, the lakes and ponds being almost
everywhere dried up, a couple of Frogs agreed to travel together
in search of water. At last they came to a deep well, and,
sitting on the brink of it, began to consult whether they should
leap in or no. One of them was so inclined, urging that there was
plenty of clear, spring water, and no danger of being disturbed.
"Well," says the other, "all this may be true, and yet I cannot
come into your opinion for my life; for if the water should
happen to dry up here too, how should we get out again."</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<p>Skilful generals always secure a way for retreat. "Look before
you leap" is an old and trite proverb. We should not undertake

<h3>THE CAT, THE COCK, AND THE YOUNG MOUSE.</h3>




<p>A <span class="smcap">Young</span> Mouse, that had seen very little of the world, came
running, one day, to his mother in great haste:&mdash;"Oh, mother!"
said he, "I am frightened almost to death! I have seen the most
extraordinary creature that ever was. He has a fierce, angry
look, and struts about on two legs; a strange piece of flesh
grows on his head, and another under his throat, as red as blood:
he flapped his arms against his sides, as if he intended to rise
into the air; and stretching out his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>head, he opened a
sharp-pointed mouth so wide, that I thought he was preparing to
swallow me up: then he roared at me so horribly, that I trembled
in every joint, and was glad to run home as fast as I could. If I
had not been frightened away by this terrible monster, I was just
going to commence an acquaintance with the prettiest creature you
ever saw. She had a soft fur skin, thicker than ours, and all
beautifully streaked with black and grey; with a modest look, and
a demeanour so humble and courteous, that methought I could have
fallen in love with her. Then she had a fine, long tail, which
she waved about so prettily, and looked so earnestly at me, that
I do believe she was just going to speak to me, when the horrid
monster frightened me away."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear child!" said the mother, "you have escaped being
devoured, but not by that monster you were so much afraid of;
which, in truth, was only a bird, and would have done you no
manner of harm. Whereas, the sweet creature, of whom you seem so
fond, was no other than a Cat; who, under that hypocritical
countenance, conceals the most inveterate hatred to all our race,
and subsists entirely by devouring Mice. Learn from this
incident, my dear, never, while you live, to rely on outward
appearances."</p>

<h3>THE MICE AND THE TRAP.</h3>


<p>Once upon a time, the Mice saw a broiled rasher of bacon hanging
up in a very little room, the door of which being open, enticed
them to fall on with greedy appetites. But some of them took
particular notice that there was but one way into the room, and,
by consequence, but one way to get out of it; so that, if that
door, by misfortune or art, should chance to be shut, they would
all be inevitably taken: they could not, therefore, find in their
hearts to venture in; but said, that they had rather content
themselves with homely fare, in safety, than, for the sake of a
dainty bit, to run the danger of being taken, and lost for ever.</p>

<p>The other Mice, who were looked upon to be great epicures,
declared that they saw no danger; and, therefore, ran into the
room, and fell to eating the bacon with great delight: but they
soon heard the door fall down, and saw that they were all taken.
Then the fear of approaching death so seized them, that they
found no relish in their exquisite food; and immediately came the
Cook who had set the Trap, and killed them: but the others, who
had contented themselves with their usual food, fled into their
holes, and, by that means, preserved their lives.</p>

<h3>THE WOLF, THE FOX, AND THE ASS.</h3>


<p>The Lion, as king of the beasts, made a law that no beast should,
without lawful cause, do any hurt to another; and should come
once a year to court, to confess, and be absolved or punished,
according to his deserts. Now it happened that the Wolf and the
Fox were going thither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> together, and overtaking the Ass on the
road, said to him:&mdash;"Brother, it is a long way to court, and it
certainly must be much more tedious to you than to ourselves,
because of your slow pace; but we can avoid the trouble of going
thither, if you think fit. Let us three confess ourselves to one
another, and send our absolutions to court, attested by two of us
as witnesses."</p>

<p>The Ass liked the proposal; into a clover field they went, and
the Fox thus confessed himself first:&mdash;"It happened, as I was
going one night through a village, a Cock, by his loud crowing,
disturbed all the people that were asleep; at which I grew very
angry, and bit off his head; then, fearing that the stench of his
dead body might be offensive to the Hens, I ate him up.
Nevertheless, it happened, three days after, as I was going by
the same village, those very Hens spied me; and, instead of
thanking me for the great kindness I had done them, cried out,
'Murderer, murderer!' Then I, in defence of my honour, killed
three of them; and, lest they should have stunk and offended the
neighbourhood, ate them up too. This is all I have done; for
which I now await your sentence."</p>

<p>The Wolf thereupon expressed himself thus:&mdash;"You have, indeed,
offended against the letter of our monarch's law, but not against
the meaning of it; since your intentions were honourable, to take
care of the quiet of men, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> vindicate your injured
reputation. If, therefore, you will promise never to be so hasty
again in killing any beast, I vote for your absolution." This the
Fox readily did; and the Ass joined in opinion with the Wolf, who
then thus began his confession:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As I was one day walking along, I saw a Sow trampling down the
corn of a poor peasant, and tearing it up by the roots, while her
hungry Pigs were strayed far from her, and could not get
themselves out of the mire; so that I, growing very angry at the
great mischief she did the peasant, and at her neglect of
motherly duty, killed and ate her up. Three days after, chancing
to go again the same way, I observed that those Pigs were grown
very lean; and reflecting that, through want of their mother's
milk, they would certainly die a languishing death, I put an end
to their miseries, and ate them up too. This I have to confess."</p>

<p>The Fox instantly argued in this manner:&mdash;"Though you confess to
having killed both mother and children; and though it seems, at
first sight, that you have heinously offended against the law of
our king; yet I see, nevertheless, that your intentions were
good: to prevent mischief from falling upon men, to stir up a
mother to her duty, and to show compassion to her miserable
children, are virtues that no law can forbid or punish. I,
therefore, declare you absolved." To which the Ass agreed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ass then made his confession:&mdash;"You both know," said he,
"that it is not in my nature to do hurt to other beasts, nor to
shed blood; and, therefore, you cannot expect to hear any such
thing from me; but, to content you, I will relate to you what
happened innocently to me, while I was in the service of a
master. He was an old man, and apt to take cold in his feet; so
that, when he travelled, to keep them dry and warm, he was wont
to stick a little hay in his shoes. Now I carried him, one
winter, to an inn, where he was to lie all night; and when we
came to the door, the innkeeper brought him a pair of dry
slippers, that his dirty shoes might not soil the house; so that
he pulled them off, and left them without, and me by them. In
short, my master and his host found themselves so well in the
chimney-corner, that they never thought of poor me; but left me
all night in the bitter cold, without giving me a handful of
food: so that I ate up all the hay that stuck in his shoes. This
is all I have to say;&mdash;if you will call it a confession, you may:
however, I think nothing can be said against it."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the Fox, immediately, "this is not, indeed, an offence
against the letter of the law, which mentions only the doing hurt
to beasts, and takes no notice of eating of hay; but, if we
reflect on the dangerous consequences of this action, and that so
reverend a creature as a chill, aged man, by being thus robbed of
his hay in the winter, and the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> day continuing his road
without it, might have caught a cold, a cough, and a cholic, that
would have brought his grey hairs to the grave:&mdash;whoever, I say,
reflects on this, cannot but be of my opinion,&mdash;which is, that
the Ass largely deserves to die. Cousin Wolf, what say you to
this matter?" "I," said the Wolf, "am of opinion that by reason
of the ill consequences that might have attended this action, the
Ass deserves a double death, and to be made an example to
others." With that he leaped upon him, and tore out his throat,
and the Fox and he immediately ate him up.</p>

<h3>THE BOY AND THE BUTTERFLY.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">boy</span>, greatly smitten with the colours of a Butterfly, pursued
it from flower to flower with indefatigable pains. First, he
aimed to surprise it among the leaves of a rose; then to cover it
with his hat, as it was feeding on a daisy; now hoped to secure
it, as it rested on a sprig of myrtle;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> and now grew sure of his
prize, perceiving it loiter on a bed of violets. But the fickle
Fly, continually changing one blossom for another, still eluded
his attempts. At length, observing it half buried in the cup of a
tulip, he rushed forward, and snatching it with violence, crushed
it all to pieces.</p>


<p class="center">MORAL.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pleasure, like the Butterfly,<br /></span>

<h3>THE CROW AND THE PITCHER.</h3>


<p>A <span class="smcap">Crow</span>, ready to die with thirst, flew with joy to a Pitcher,
which he beheld at some distance. When he came he found water in
it, indeed, but so near the bottom that, with all his stooping
and straining, he was not able to reach it. Then he endeavoured
to overturn the Pitcher, that so at least he might be able to get
a little of it. But his strength was not sufficient for this. At
last, seeing some pebbles lie near the place, he cast them one by
one into the Pitcher;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> and thus, by degrees, raised the water up
to the very brim, and satisfied his thirst.</p>

<p>Necessity is the mother of invention, and that which cannot be
accomplished by strength may be achieved by ingenuity.</p>
